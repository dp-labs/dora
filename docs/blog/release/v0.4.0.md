# Dora v0.4.0 Release Blog: Performance Boost, Enhanced Stability & Reth Integration

## ✨ What’s New

+ **Performance Optimization**: Introduced **static jump analysis for non-EOF EVM bytecode**, enabling smarter native code generation and delivering **~5% faster execution speeds** for legacy EVM contracts.
+ **Rock-Solid EVM & WASM Stability**
    + Strengthened memory load/store bound checks with 100+ new out-of-bounds test suites
    + Added rigorous conversion/truncation tests for numeric overflows
    + Expanded EVM-WASM interoperability tests and real Ethereum block/tx validation.
+ **Seamless Reth Integration**: Introduced the `dora-reth` package, which
implements a custom Reth Alloy EVM, which can be used to replace the EthEVM (Revm) with the Dora VM implementation when starting a reth node. It can provide high-performance compilation and WASM code execution. For more information on how to enable custom EVM in Reth, please refer to the [dora-reth package](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/tree/main/integrations/reth) and [example](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/main/examples/custom-evm/src/main.rs).
