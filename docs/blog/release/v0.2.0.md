# Dora v0.2.0 Release Blog: MVP Milestone Achieved

We are excited to announce the release of **Dora v0.2.0**, marking a significant step forward as we present our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version.

## Key Achievements

+ **EVM Feature Implementation and Testing**: We have successfully implemented and tested most EVM features, with an impressive **95% test pass rate** on [Ethereum tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
+ **Developer Tools and Integrations**: We have released a [Dora C binding](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/tree/main/bindings/c) with [EVMC](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc) integration. These tools will enable developers to leverage EVMC and Dora to implement high-performance virtual machines or blockchain clients in other programming languages like [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), etc.
+ **Performance**: We still focus on performance optimization, our performance gains **7-10** times increase in Uniswap v3 contract compared to some interpreter versions. In addition, we can find more benchmark test results [here](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/tree/main/tests/bench).
