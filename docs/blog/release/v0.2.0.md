# Dora v0.2.0 Release Blog: MVP Milestone Achieved

We are excited to announce the release of **Dora v0.2.0**, marking a significant step forward as we present our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version. Building upon the solid foundation laid in v0.1.0, we have completed the implementation and stability testing of the majority of EVM features. This achievement is a testament to our commitment to delivering a robust and reliable platform.

## Key Achievements

+ **EVM Feature Implementation and Testing**: We have successfully implemented and tested most EVM features, ensuring that our platform meets the high standards required for blockchain technology, with an impressive **95% test pass rate** on [Ethereum tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
+ **Developer Tools and Integrations**: To further empower the developer community, we have preliminarily released a [Dora C binding](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/tree/main/bindings/c) with [EVMC](https://github.com/ethereum/evmc) integration. These tools will enable developers to leverage EVMC and Dora to implement high-performance virtual machines or blockchain clients in other programming languages like [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth), etc.
+ **Performance**: We have seen significant performance improvements across the vast majority of contract scenarios. In particular, our performance gains in Uniswap v3 contract testing have been remarkable, with a **7-10** times increase compared to some interpreter versions.
