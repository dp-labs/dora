# Dora v0.3.0 Release Blog: Embark on New Era of Integration between EVM and WASM

We are excited to announce the release of **Dora v0.3.0**, a significant milestone in our journey to provide a unified development platform for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) technologies. This release brings a host of new features, improvements, and integrations that enhance the developer experience and expand the capabilities of Dora.

## Key Achievements

+ **WASM Feature Implementation and Testing**: We have successfully implemented and tested most WASM features, with an impressive **100% test pass rate** on [WASM spec tests](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/main/test/core). We can find more Dora WASM examples [here](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/tree/main/examples/wasm) such as `fibonacci`, `keccak256` and `ERC20`.
+ **Developer Tools and Integrations**: Dora now supports the community's **EVM contract toolchains e.g., [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat)**, and **WASM toolchain e.g., [Stylus](https://github.com/PharosNetwork/pharos-cargo-stylus)** integration. We can find more toolchain examples [here](https://github.com/dp-labs/examples).
+ **Unified User Interface**: We can now use a unified API and CLI to run EVM and WASM bytecode and achieve interoperability, sharing the same account model and world state.
