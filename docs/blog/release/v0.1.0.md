# Dora v0.1.0 Release Blog: Embarking on a New Journey

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Dora v0.1.0**, a Proof of Concept (PoC) version that marks a significant milestone for our project. With this version, we have completed the preliminary implementation and verification of the [Dora technology architecture](https://github.com/dp-labs/dora/blob/main/docs/design/tech.md), and we are excited to share that Dora is now open source!

This release signifies an important starting point for the Dora project. Our goal with this version is to demonstrate the core concepts of the Dora technology architecture and provide a platform for the community to engage and contribute. We believe that by opening our source code, Dora can attract more developers and innovators to drive the technology forward together.
