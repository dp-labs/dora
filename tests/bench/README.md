# Benchmarks

You can use the following command to run all benchmarks.

```shell
cargo bench
```

Or you can specify a name to filter the corresponding tests, e.g.,

```shell
cargo bench fibonacci
```

Then you can find the benchmark results at the `target/criterion/` folder in the top level of the repo.
