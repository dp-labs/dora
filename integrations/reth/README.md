# Dora Reth Integration

This package implements a custom Reth Alloy EVM, which can be used to replace the EthEVM (Revm) with the Dora VM implementation when starting a reth node. It can provide high-performance compilation and WASM code execution. For more information on how to enable custom EVM in Reth, please refer to the [example](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/blob/main/examples/custom-evm/src/main.rs).
