/// - Creates a new `MLIRContext`.
/// - Appends a registry of all available dialects.
/// - Attaches a diagnostic handler that logs diagnostics to `stderr`.
/// - Loads all available dialects into the context.

///
/// A fully initialized `MLIRContext` ready for compiling and optimizing MLIR-based operations.

/// # Behavior
///
/// - This context is configured to handle diagnostics and allows unregistered dialects to be used.
/// - It includes all MLIR dialects and passes available in the current setup.
/// - The context supports LLVM translations for lowering MLIR to LLVM IR.
