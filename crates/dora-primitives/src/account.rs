/// Represents the core information of an account, including its balance, nonce, code hash, and optional bytecode.

/// # Fields:
/// - `balance`: The balance of the account, represented as a `U256`.
/// - `nonce`: The nonce of the account, represented as a `u64`.
/// - `code_hash`: A 256-bit hash of the account's contract code.
/// - `code`: Optional bytecode. If `None`, the bytecode will be fetched by the code hash when required.

/// # Methods:
/// - `is_empty`: Checks if the account is empty. An account is considered empty if its balance is zero, its nonce is zero,
///   and its `code_hash` matches the hash of an empty bytecode.
/// - `has_code`: Checks if the account contains code. Returns `true` if the `code_hash` is not zero and does not match

/// ```no_check
/// let account_info = AccountInfo::default();
